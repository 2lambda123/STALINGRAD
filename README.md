# Stalin∇

Stalin∇ is a brutally optimizing compiler for the VLAD language, a
pure dialect of Scheme with first-class automatic differentiation
operators.

Written by Jeffrey Mark Siskind, with Barak A. Pearlmutter doing a
little cheerleading.

For now, see http://www.bcl.hamilton.ie/~qobi/stalingrad/

Actual code and history should appear in this repo in due course.
