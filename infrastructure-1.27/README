We have adopted a new infrastructure for all of the software that we develop
and distribute.  You must set up an isomorphic infrastructure in order to
install any of our software releases.  This new infrastructure is designed to
allow us to support multiple architectures and shared software components with
minimum effort.

Most of our software is built on top of Scheme->C.  Because it is necessary to
apply a number of patches to Scheme->C, and because the installation of
Scheme->C is complex and varies widely from architecture to architecture, we
now include a virgin 15mar93 Scheme->C distribution with Infrastructure along
with virgin patches for SPARC, Linux, and FreeBSD, our own patches, and a
script that automatically builds and installs Scheme->C with the appropriate
patches for Linux, FreeBSD, SunOS 4, SunOS 5, IRIX 4, IRIX 5, IRIX 6, and
OSF/1.  You will need to modify this script for other architectures.  If you
modify the installation script, say to support another architecture, please
send us your modifications so that we can include them in a future release.

To install, first, unpack this infrastructure distribution:

% uncompress infrastructure-1.27.tar.Z
% tar xvf infrastructure-1.27.tar
% rm infrastructure-1.27.tar
% cd infrastructure-1.27

Second, do the following for each architecture (on a machine of the
appropriate architecture):

% ./build

Third, define the environment variables QARCHITECTURE_PATH to be
`architecture-path` and QINSTALLDIR to be your home directory.  For example:

% setenv QARCHITECTURE_PATH `~/bin/architecture-path`
% setenv QINSTALLDIR ~

These last two lines could be added to your .cshrc.

Fourth, put ~/bin and ~/bin/`~/bin/architecture-path` in your $PATH,
if they are not already there.  For example:

% set path = (~/bin/${QARCHITECTURE_PATH} ~/bin $path)

This last line could be added to your .cshrc.

Before building on IRIX 5 and IRIX 6 you need to make sure that you have the
files crt1.o, crtn.o, libc.a, and libm.a in /usr/lib/nonshared.  These files
are part of IRIX 5 and IRIX 6 but are not installed at some sites.  They are
included in this distribution for you to install if needed.

Thanks to Marc Feeley for giving me access to an Alpha running OSF/1 and to
the Computer Science Department at Rice University for giving me access to a
Pentium Pro running FreeBSD to produce those ports.
