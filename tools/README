unbuff.c

  Usage: unbuff command ...
    Run a subsidiary command in such a way that its standard
    output will not be buffered, and that its standard error
    will be merged with its standard output.

  This is obsolete: use the GNU coreutils stdbuf command instead, and
  use standard shell mechanisms for redirecting standard error into
  standard output.

  used to play videos inside a hot-wired version of xpdf
